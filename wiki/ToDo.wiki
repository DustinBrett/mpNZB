#summary To-Do list for project

== Coding Issues: ==
  * Change NZBsRus URL grabber to something better
    * Also add NZBsRus categories to list
    * Feeds can be easy if I can just get i= and h= during D/L
    * Grab i= and h= on Site.Init and save them as var's?
      * How best to grab them without parsing HTML?
  * Progress bar works intermittently
    * Stops working after clicking NZBsRus ?maybe?
    * Test new code
