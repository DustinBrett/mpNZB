#summary A list of sites that could be added to Sites.xml

= Introduction =

This page is were I put sites that are known to work with Sites.xml but require a special string be placed in the URL so they are not included with the default Sites.xml file. In the future this site may be not needed once I can figure out how to grab this information on the fly.
